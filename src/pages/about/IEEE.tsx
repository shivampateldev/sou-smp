              <p className="mb-4">
                The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) was formed in 1963 through the merger of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE), founded in 1884, and the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), founded in 1912. As the world's largest technical professional society, IEEE is dedicated to advancing innovation and technological excellence for the benefit of humanity.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                With a global presence, IEEE has more than 423,000 members across 160+ countries, including over 117,000 student members. It operates through 342 sections in 10 geographic regions worldwide and facilitates collaboration through 2,562 chapters and 3,485 student branches across more than 100 countries. Additionally, 2,877 student branch chapters of IEEE technical societies and 580 affinity groups (including IEEE-USA Consultants' Network, Young Professionals, Women in Engineering, Life Members, and IEEE Entrepreneurship) provide support for diverse professional communities.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                A key leader in global standards development, IEEE has played a crucial role in shaping modern communication networks through its IEEE 802 standards, including Ethernet and Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi).
